# recital-pianos
First large scale project. An E-commerce site.

This site was written for/with a friend who's owns a piano shop but the site is outdated so we brought it into the 21st century.
The server was written in Java and we used MySql as our DB, we also utilized rest API.
The Client was written utilizing JQuery and Bootstrap frameworks.
